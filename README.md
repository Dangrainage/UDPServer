# UDPServer
A small UDPServer written in ruby 

# Flags
```-p <port number>``` (mandatory)

Using -p you will define the port within the command, not using It the program will error out.

```-o <output file name>``` (optional)

Using -o will log everything to the file name you define, not using It everything goes to stdout.

```-n true``` (optional)

Using ``-n`` will remove logging details (messages like "UDP Server listening on..") from getting logged to the output file.
