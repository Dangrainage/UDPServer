# UDPServer
A small UDPServer written in ruby 

# Flag
```-p <port number>```

Using -p you will define the port within the command, not using It the program will ask you when you run It. 

```-o <output file name>```

Using -o will log everything to the file name you define, not using It everything goes to stdout.
